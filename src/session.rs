//! Filesystem session
//!
//! A session runs a filesystem implementation while it is being mounted to a specific mount
//! point. A session begins by mounting the filesystem and ends by unmounting it. While the
//! filesystem is mounted, the session loop receives, dispatches and replies to kernel requests
//! for filesystem operations under its mount point.
